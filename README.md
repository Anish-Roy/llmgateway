# LLM Gateway

An OpenAI-compatible proxy in front of multiple LLM providers, with fallback, per-key rate
limits, exact and semantic caching, PII masking and a cost dashboard.

Status: Phase 2 done (Groq + Gemini behind model aliases, with retry and fallback). See
[plan.md](plan.md) for the roadmap.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync                                   # create .venv and install deps
cp .env.example .env                      # then add your provider keys
docker compose up -d                      # Postgres 17 + pgvector on localhost:5433
uv run python -m scripts.migrate          # create/update tables (safe to rerun)
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload      # http://localhost:8000/health
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

Clients ask for a model **alias**, not a vendor model. Aliases and the providers behind them
live in [config/models.yaml](config/models.yaml):

| Alias | Tried in order | |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | Groq `openai/gpt-oss-20b` → Gemini `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` | cheap, quick |
| `strong` | Groq `openai/gpt-oss-120b` → Gemini `gemini-3.8-flash` | better answers |
| `mock` | mock provider | no keys needed |
| `demo-fallback` | always-failing mock → mock | fallback demo, no keys |
| `demo-midstream` | mock that fails mid-answer → mock | streaming failure demo, no keys |

`GET /v1/models` lists the aliases this deployment can serve. If a provider times out, rate
limits (429) or errors (5xx), the gateway retries once where that helps and moves to the next
entry. It doesn't fall back on a bad request (400), which every provider would reject. The
response's `model` is the model that actually answered, and the `x-gateway-provider`,
`x-gateway-attempts` and `x-gateway-fallback` headers show how it got there.

Providers retire models and change free-tier access often. Check the registry against what
your keys can actually use:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.check_models
```

Try it with the official `openai` SDK (needs `GROQ_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`):

```bash
uv run python scripts/smoke_openai_sdk.py                  # model "fast"
uv run python scripts/smoke_openai_sdk.py --model strong
uv run python scripts/smoke_openai_sdk.py --model mock     # no keys needed
```

To watch fallback without any keys, ask for `demo-fallback`. Its first provider always fails
with a 503 and is retried once, then the mock answers:

```bash
curl -si localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "demo-fallback", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'
```

Look for `x-gateway-provider: mock`, `x-gateway-attempts: 3` and `x-gateway-fallback: true`.

### Streaming

`stream=True` returns server-sent events in OpenAI's chunk format, ending with `data: [DONE]`.
Add `stream_options={"include_usage": True}` to get a final chunk with token usage. Fallback
works until the first token: the gateway picks a provider before it starts the response, so a
provider that fails early is replaced, and if all of them fail you get a normal JSON error. Once
part of the answer has been sent, a failure ends the stream with an error event instead of
`[DONE]`, and the openai SDK raises it as an `APIError`. `demo-midstream` shows this:

```bash
curl -sN localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "demo-midstream", "stream": true, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'
```

Every provider streams: Groq passes its OpenAI-format chunks through, and Gemini's
`streamGenerateContent` events are translated into the same format.

```

## Query log

`data/queries.jsonl` has 378 prompts for evaluating the cache and router. Each row has an
`id`, `prompt`, `category`, `difficulty` (`easy`/`hard`), and two optional links:

- `dup_of`: a near-duplicate of another prompt (same meaning). The semantic cache should hit.
- `trap_of`: looks similar to another prompt but needs a different answer. The cache must not hit.

Edit the prompts in `scripts/build_dataset.py` and regenerate with
`uv run python scripts/build_dataset.py`.
